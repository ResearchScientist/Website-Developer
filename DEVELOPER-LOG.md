Had loads of fun making the custom cursor for the website. Wanted something small that would not overwhelm the user , but still be functional and informative.

A happily floating astronaut , there's something zen about it.

Decided to make the houses on the planet as line drawings. This will keep with the aesthetic of contrasting full complex 3D imagery against minimal 2D art.

Really wanted a variable content drop down section on click. Initially was going to use the shadow dom and custom elements but since those are not indexable by search bots I decided to save their implementation for another project. Instead I made use of flex grid and overflow hidden to obtain the effect I wanted. Pretty happy with the result.
